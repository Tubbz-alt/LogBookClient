Datatypes
*********
The Elog Client uses a few classes to represent various components involved in
the posting process including; :class:`.datatypes.LogEntry`,
:class:`.datatypes.Tag`, :class:`.datatypes.Logbook` and
:class:`.datatypes.Attachment`. While these largely should be instantiated by
higher level functions, it maybe helpful to know the underlying methods for
each class, and how they store pertinent metadata.

.. autoclass:: LogBookClient.Logbook
   :members:

.. autoclass:: LogBookClient.LogEntry
   :members:

.. autoclass:: LogBookClient.Tag
   :members:

.. autoclass:: LogBookClient.Attachment
   :members:
