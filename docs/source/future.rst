Future Improvements
*******************
There are a few improvements to the underlying LogBookClient to be made that
could open up quite a bit of functionality within the API. The major one is the
lack of a search function that would allow the user to programatically search
back in the Elog history.

It would also be interesting to expand upon the module specific saving
functions to avoid having to take screenshots all of the time. Most of the
higher level graphs and screens at LCLS seem to be made using ``pyqtgraph`` or
``PyQt``. Creating functions to simply save these from the command line instead
of dragging screenshots around could be nice.
